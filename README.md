# react-stores
Shared states for React.js (a flux-way shared stores without actions and dispatchers).

## How to install
```
npm i react-stores --save
```

## How to use

First you need to create a `Store` singleton
```typescript
// store.ts
import {Store} from "react-stores";

export namespace CommonStore {
    // State interface
    export interface State {
        counter: number
    }

    // Store's state initial values
    let initialState: State = {
        counter: 0
    };

    export let store: Store<State> = new Store<State>(initialState);
}
```

Then you need to create a `StoreComponent` that will use store singleton
```typescript
// component.tsx
import * as React from "react";
import {StoreComponent, Store} from "react-stores";
import {CommonStore} from "./store.ts";

interface Props {
    name: string
}
ะะบ
interface State {
    counter: number
}

interface StoresState {
    common: Store<CommonStore.State>
}

export class App extends StoreComponent<Props, State, StoresState> {
    constructor() {
        super({
            common: CommonStore.store
        });
    }
    
    // This method is required by abstract method in StoreComponent
    //it works as default React.Component.componentDidMount()
    storeComponentDidMount() {

    }
    
    // This method is required by abstract method in StoreComponent
    // it works as default React.Component.componentWillUnmount()
    storeComponentWillUnmount() {

    }

    private increaseCommon():void {
        // You can mutate stores as local component state values
        this.stores.common.setState({
            counter: this.stores.common.state.counter + 1
        };
    }

    private increaseLocal():void {
        // You can use local state as natural React.Component
        this.setState({
            counter: this.state.counter + 1
        });
    }

    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <p>Component name: {this.props.name}</p>
	            <p>Shared counter value: {this.stores.common.state.counter.toString()}</p>
                <p>Local counter value: {this.state.counter.toString()}</p>

                <button onClick={this.increaseCommon.bind(this)}>Increase common counter value</button>
                <button onClick={this.increaseLocal.bind(this)}>Increase local counter value</button>
            </div>
        );
    }
}
```

Now you can use it as usial
```typescript
import {App} from "./component";

ReactDOM.render(
	React.createElement(App),
	document.getElementById('app')
);
```

You can mutate states from any point of your app like this
```typescript
import {CommonStore} from "./store";

CommonStore.store.setState({
	counter: 100500
});
```

...or even like a flux actions
```typescript
import {CommonStore} from "./store";

export class CommonActions {
	static increaseCounter(state:CommonStore.State):void {
		CommonStore.store.setState(state);
	}
}

// Note that you always have your store interface, you haven't lost typization consistency 
// of your app like it always occurs in Flux/Redux apps in action -> store communication
let newState:CommonStore.State = {
	counter: 100500
}

CommonActions.increaseCounter(newState);
```

Also you can get store state values from everywhere in your app
```typescript
import {CommonStore} from "./store";

console.log(CommonStore.store.state.counter);
```
